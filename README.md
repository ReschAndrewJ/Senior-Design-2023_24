1) ### Team Names and Project Abstract

    Advisor - Fred Annexstein

    Many attempt to learn an additional language. While not everyone succeeds, having effective learning tools can make the process much easier. This project is to make an Android app for studying the Japanese language.
    The application will let the user save and retrieve words and their definitions. The user will be able to search for words they have saved using either the word or its definition.

3) ### User Stories and Design Diagrams

    - [User Stories](User_Stories.md)
    - [Design Diagrams](Design_Diagrams)
        - [Level 0](Design_Diagrams/DesignD0.png)
        - [Level 1](Design_Diagrams/DesignD1.png)
        - [Level 2](Design_Diagrams/DesignD2.png)
    - Design Diagram Descriptions
        - Level 0: Diagram D0 describes the core function of the application as a dictionary. Arrows going left-to-right signify actions by the user, and a smaller arrow underneath going right-to-left signifies a response from the application.
        - Level 1: Diagram D1 describes the transitions between pages of the application and what functionalities each page is planned to have. Each outer box contains a page name and an inner box which lists that page's functionalities. Arrows between pages are labeled with the action that triggers a transition from the first page to the next.
        - Level 2: Diagram D2 describes the layouts of each page with descriptions of each element's function. It also shows the planned structure of the SQLite database to be used by the application.
