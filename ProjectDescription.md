### Project Topic Area

An Android application that is a Japanese dictionary where the user provides the words that they want to store

### Project Abstract

The project is:

An application for Android that is a Japanese language dictionary where the user provides the words that they want to store. Words can be searched for by spelling or definition, and words can be assigned into groups which can be used as study lists. When a user learns additional definitions of a word, they can edit the entry for that word to also have the new definition.

### Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Dictionaries and flashcard apps are both common tools used for studying a language. However, both have their limitations. A dictionary can not help you choose what words to study; they contain too many words that aren't likely to be highly important to know. Flashcard apps serve as a list to study, but they are generally unhelpful for looking up a word you added.

### Applicable Background and Interests

- Some experience with Godot Engine
- Coursework in SQL databases
- Studying Japanese language & culture

### Approach to Problem

My approach takes inspiration from both dictionaries and flash cards. The main structure of the project application is that of a dictionary, where the user can look up a word. However, it will only contain words added by the user, so that the user knows that every word in the dictionary has tangible value. The app will also have a word-groups system, which the user can utilize to create vocabulary lists within the app.
