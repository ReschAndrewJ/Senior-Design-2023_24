### Team Name - AjR

Andrew Resch (Computer Science) - reschaj@mail.uc.edu

#### Advisor

Fred Annexstein - fred.annexstein@uc.edu

### Project Topic Area

An Android application that is a Japanese dictionary where the user provides the words that they want to store

### Project Abstract

Many make the attempt to learn an additional language. And while not everyone succeeds, having effective learning tools can make the process much easier. This project is to make one such tool, with the app being tuned for studying the Japanese language. 

The application will be developed for Android devices and will make use of a database for the user to save and retrieve words and their definitions. The user will be able to search for words they have saved using either the word or the definition.

### Inadequacy of Current Solutions

Dictionaries and flashcard apps are both common tools used for studying a language. However, both have their limitations. A dictionary can not help you choose what words to study; they contain too many words that aren't likely to be highly important to know. Flashcard apps serve as a list to study, but they are generally unhelpful for looking up a word you added.

### Applicable Background and Interests

- Some experience with Godot Engine
- Coursework in SQL databases
- Studying Japanese language & culture

### Approach to Problem

My approach takes inspiration from both dictionaries and flash cards. The main structure of the project application is that of a dictionary, where the user can look up a word. However, it will only contain words added by the user, so that the user knows that every word in the dictionary has tangible value. The app will also have a word-groups system, which the user can utilize to create vocabulary lists within the app.
