1)
As a Japanese-language student, I want to record all of the vocabulary words covered in class, so that if I forget a word I can easily look it up.

2)
As someone who is using media to study Japanese, I want to mark what books or shows a word is present in, so that I can recall the contexts that each word is used in.

3)
As a Japanese-language learner, I want to track how many words I know, so that I have an estimate of my learning progress.
